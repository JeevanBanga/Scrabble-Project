# Scrabble-Project
This project is a Scrabble word to point value converter. When given a Scrabble word, it returns a print statement letting the user know how many points their word is worth in Scrabble points.

# Concepts displayed:
- Python dictionaries to organize data
- Dictionary comprehension and zip function to combine lists
- Making a function to iterate over key, value pairs as tuples to continuously update a point total
